# Group Charter: Group 802-3
### Meetings:  Tuesday, 2:30-3:50pm
##### Group Contacts: 
- Nick (nickigl@uwm.edu)
- George
- Sut (suttuang@uwm.edu)
- Colin
- Humraj (hsbharya@uwm.edu)

#### Goals:
1. To adhere well as a group, respecting each member, and supporting each member by 
working together to accomplish the goals listed below and adhering to this charter. 

2. To gain a more intimate knowledge of the software life cycle by working as a group to 
develop a quality product worth the letter grade of an “A”.  

3. To attain practical knowledge and experience of what it means to be a software engineer 
and to familiarize ourselves with the methods and practices that are required to pull 
together a team project.

#### Work Norms: 
1. Time commitment required by each group member:  
Time commitment is a difficult thing to determine seeing one member may be able to 
complete the same job in a less amount of time. The goal is to complete the job. If one 
member is taking a substantial amount of time more than the others, it will be examined 
by the group as to whether his work load should be decreased. 
 
2. Dealing with different work habits: 
The work habits of any particular member will not be an issue as long as the member 
communicates progress, produces quality work, and the work is done by the dates 
established by the group. If the member does not meet these standards, procedures to deal 
with that member are further detailed in the ground rules. 
 
#### Ground Rules: 
 
- ****Meetings:****
 
1. Length of meetings: 
The main meeting of the week is during lab (Tuesday 2:30-3:50).
Meetings may have to take as long as it takes, however meetings longer than 1 ½ hours 
are discouraged. The purpose of meetings is to establish communication and give 
direction to the project. Meetings once a week should be enough unless it is decided by 
the group that additional meetings should be scheduled. This communication should take 
place through the group email. It is understood that if a meeting takes too long, members 
may have to leave for classes or work obligations. This type of situation will not 
constitute an offense. 
 
2. Missing a meeting: 
An occasional missing of a meeting can be accepted. If however an individual repeatedly 
misses a meeting without good cause, some disciplinary action may have to be taken. 
Acceptable justification of a missed meeting includes, but is not limited to: injury, illness, 
family emergency, work, conflicting class schedule, or death (yourself or other). If a 
meeting is missed for any other reason, the affected group members will decide as to 
whether the reason for missing the meeting is acceptable or in need of disciplinary action. 
Two meetings missed without emailed valid excuse will result in a minor offence. Three 
will result in a major offence. 
 
3. Tardiness to meetings: 
A person being obviously late for a meeting and not fitting the structure of "on time" shall 
be given over to disciplinary action as described in minor offence. On time means the 
time the meeting is scheduled to start (2:30pm on Tuesdays). If an individual arrives at a 
meeting after the start time and the meeting has yet to get into purposeful conversation 
then it may be overlooked. However if there is no good excuse for being late and the 
meeting is clearly underway when the individual arrives then at the end of the meeting it 
will be discussed as to whether disciplinary action will have to be taken. Being late to a 
meeting more than once constitutes a minor offence.
 
- **Group communication and interaction:**
 
1. Regular communication: 
Regular communication should occur every two days via teams. This communication 
should include a simple update on ones progress of their portion of the project. When a 
member finishes their portion of the project, they should submit a pull request to the group
repository allowing for each group members approval. If a member forgets to submit their 
progress, any member can send an inquiry teams message to the person who forgot. If the teams 
message is not responded to in 24 hours, the group will begin to take on that member‟s 
responsibilities through the decision making process stated in part six of this section. If the member has a good 
reason for not responding, it will be taken into consideration as to whether there will be 
disciplinary action; otherwise it will be an immediate minor offense. If however, the 
member responds within the 24 hour time period stating they forgot, no disciplinary 
action will be taken. If a member is having problems with their portion of the work, they 
should inform the group immediately, so they can receive any needed help 
as soon as possible.  
 
1. Group communication on tardiness/missed meetings and meeting information: 
If a member has prior knowledge of a missed meeting or tardiness of a day or more, that 
member shall send a teams message to all group members signifying such. If it is the day of the 
meeting and a group member is going to miss the meeting or knows they are going to be 
tardy by more than five minutes, that member shall send a teams message to all group 
members informing them of the situation. Failure to do so more than once will result in a 
minor offense.  
 
1. Communication ethics: 
There shall be an understanding among group members that all opinions or input by any 
individual member is valued and will be respected, even if disagreed with. People and/or 
their opinions shall not in any way be degraded or dismissed but all opinions shall have 
equal consideration. If a member feels his opinions are being rejected without good 
reason, he has a right to bring it up to the group leader and/or the group. The group will 
then discuss the situation and either reconsider their opinions, or make a case as to why 
the members opinions are not being used. If there is such a disagreement, the note taker 
or agenda maker will record the situation as well as the member who feels disregarded. If 
this situation happens more than three times the member has a right to go to the TA and 
state their case. If the problem is not solved by the TA, the opportunity is then open to 
state their case to Rock. 
 
1. Group structure: 
The group shall have the following roles to help the group be more efficient: 
Yoda – This role belongs to the group leader. This jedi master is responsible for the flow 
of the meeting and has a helpful role in the delegation of responsibilities. 
R2-D2 – This role belongs to the meeting note taker. This droid is responsible to take 
notes at all the meetings and to relay the important information and any decisions made 
during the meeting to the other members via email by the end of the next day. They will 
also be responsible for recording any disciplinary actions taken toward any member of 
the group. 
Han Solo – This role belongs to the agenda maker. This member of the rebellion is 
responsible for making an agenda of subjects which need to be covered in the upcoming 
meeting. The agenda shall be emailed to the group before Saturday for a Monday meeting 
and three days before any other meeting.  
If any member in a role does not follow through with his responsibilities on multiple 
occasions or if for some reason a member is not able to perform their duties, they shall be 
replaced by group decision.  
 
1. Decision making: 
Any decisions which need to be made about the project, project direction or disciplinary 
action will be made by a majority vote. Any decisions about delegation will be covered in 
part six. 
 
1. Group decisions on delegation: 
The delegation of responsibilities to group members will be decided in the following 
fashion. The responsibilities will be discussed and decided on as a group decision. Then 
each group member has the opportunity to volunteer for the task he may want. If a group 
member does not volunteer for a task, they will be assigned one by Yoda. If a group 
member feels the portion of responsibility is unfair, they may voice their concern and 
state a reason why. If a majority of the group feels this member is correct, the 
responsibilities will be reformed and the delegation process will start again.  
Group participation and work quality 
 
1. Group participation: 
If a group member isn‟t participating or is over participating it will be the Yoda‟s 
responsibility to politely ask the member to share either more or less based on the 
situation. If some is asked to share what they think or is asked to give others a chance to 
share, but they do not, and their under or over sharing is blocking the flow of the meeting, 
then by group decision it may be considered a minor offense.  
 
1. Work not up to standard: 
Group standards, regarding quality and timeliness of work, are important to uphold if we 
aim to succeed as a group. With goal 2 in mind we should always be putting forth the 
effort necessary to submit our best work. However, if there is a problem it should be 
handled in the following manner. It is understandable that at some point in this project 
someone may not be able to put in the time or effort necessary to meet group standards. If 
that should happen he must notify the group as soon as possible so the task can be 
redistributed, using the system established in group decisions and delegation, and the 
group can continue functioning at its highest level. If he continues to repeat this behavior 
it may result in a minor or major offence depending on the severity.  In any case a minor 
offence must be given to the individual, for this action, before a major offence can be.  At 
some point the group may seize to offer work to him as he is untrustworthy at that point. 
However, a group member may be able to redeem himself. If said member continues to 
perform above expectations for at least two weeks he shall be returned to full member 
status by way of this clause. 
 
1. Group members unprepared: 
It is understood that people are busy with other classes and school work.  If by group 
consciousness it is obvious that a member is unprepared for a meeting, and their 
unpreparedness creates a hindrance to the group and project, then disciplinary action will 
have to take place. Unpreparedness of this form will immediately result in a warning then 
a minor offence hereafter. 
 
1. Workload too heavy: 
If with the time restraints and number of group members actively participating is not 
sufficient enough to complete the task, a plea of mercy will be sent to the Rock via email 
and in person which logs the details of the amount of work to be done, the status of how 
far we are, and why we can‟t complete it in that time period.  
 
#### Disciplinary Procedures: 
 
1. Regarding disciplinary actions: 
Any disciplinary action to be administered can be overridden by group conscience, if 
decided by a majority vote. 
 
2. Disciplinary Log: 
The note taker will be responsible for logging any information on offenses committed by 
any member. This report will be sent out with the meeting notes every week so each 
member knows where they stand.  
 
3. Minor Group Offence: 
A minor group offence can occur for breaking indicated statutes of the charter. Minor 
offences require the offender to be labeled as “Storm trooper” for their stupidity. The 
storm trooper is required to prepare a delicious baked treat good either homemade or 
store bought within the next two meetings. Failure to do so will escalate them to the next 
level of offence. A record of the minor offence and when the delicious baked treat arrived 
will be recorded by the group assigned note taker. 
 
4. Major Group Offence: 
A major group offence can occur by breaking indicated statutes of the charter, or for 
accumulation of 3 or more minor offences. Major offences require that the offender be 
labeled as “Anakin Skywalker” for his treachery. Anakin Skywalker is on probation and 
his probation status is to be clearly documented by email including a detailed description 
of his offence. Anakin Skywalker may return to regular group member status upon a 
group consensus. If Anakin Skywalker commits another offence constituted as either 
minor or major, he will become a candidate for punishment and dismissal. 
 
5. Punishment and Dismissal: 
A group member committing enough minor and major offences will finally have gone to 
the dark side and demoted to Darth Vader. They will be referred to punishment and 
dismissal and will be given over to review by the TA and governing bodies (the Rock). 
An email describing the offences leading up to punishment and dismissal will be 
Group Charter: Your Team Name  
displayed along with testimonies from at least 2 other group members and a log of 
offenses. If available, the offending members work will be confiscated and termed as 
“belonging to the group”.  
 
We, the team named The Black Jaguars agree with the Group Charter and will try our best to uphold it.
